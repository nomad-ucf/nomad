## General Overview

This is a project type B game codenamed as Nomad. Nomad is a game with style inspired from others such as Journey, Sable, Rime, Wind Waker, and much more. The primary shared characteristic of these games and main purpose of Nomad is to explore toon / cel shading. A secondary characteristic we would like to capture is exploration.

The player will begin at the edge of a canyon they seemingly cannot cross. The explorable world waits just behind them. Also behind them is a broken and unusable vehicle. The player must find and return missing pieces of their vehicle to repair it. On completion of repairs the player will be able to drive their sick new ride.<br>

The win condition occurs when the player crosses the canyon using a fully repaired vehicle.
